Time does fly. It seems that my butterfly worrying feelings days before the graduation day were crystal-clear present as if it were yesterday. Since that day, my mentality and emotions have fluctuated pretty much, you know, being an actual adult, no cap. Although I am grateful for everything so far, particularly the experiences and people I had from Dickinson College and my current employment and mental state, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel&amp;hellip; regretful.</description></item><item><title>Những chữ đầu tiên</title><link>https://quanghieu31.github.io/posts/first/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 23:44:17 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://quanghieu31.github.io/posts/first/</guid><description>Hi!

Current topics mostly regard programming and economics. In the long run, I would like to be better at machine learning applications in a development context and economic/quant modelling.
I am currently studying Computer Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago (yay). I used to work for an non-profit organization in Vietnam, focusing on database and program evaluation.</description></item></channel></rss>
