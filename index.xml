Years ago, I planned to become an astronaut and play football on the moon. Time passed, plan changed. I am now working on data and policy with a dream of changing something for good.
I am a Master&amp;rsquo;s student in Computer Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago. Here, I am studying how to build good databases and relevant practices, which will be used for policy analysis and prediction tasks.</description></item></channel></rss>
