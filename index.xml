Link to heading This is for Hieu in the future. Very nice working on your first web! I am proud of you, please don&amp;rsquo;t be skeptical of yourself, even though I bet that you are right now haha.

Current topics mostly regard programming and economics. In the long run, I want to be better at machine learning applications in a development context and economic/quant modelling.
For now, I only know how to write in one language. Vietnamese and French might be produced in the future haha. Please do share anything with me regarding this web!</description></item></channel></rss>
