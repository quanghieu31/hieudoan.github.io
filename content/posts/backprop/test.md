Hello, my name This blog runs on Hugo, a publishing framework which processes markdown text files into static web assets which can be conveniently hosted on a server without a database. It is great for a number of reasons (speed, simplicity) but one area where I find it lacking is in its support for math typesetting.

$$ \partial \ell 1 + 2 = \frac{x}{y}$$


```python
print("Hello world")
```

    Hello world
