I am on a quest of finding the best learning method for me when it comes to understanding and memorizing concepts from statistics and math. I enjoy sitting in lectures and occasionally interacting with the lecturers. But then I recently realized it is not the most proactive and sustainable way to remember or know why/when/how to use concepts learned from stats class when dealing with a real-world problem. The assignments and projects are helpful but I need to feel natural and comfortable explaining and applying the knowledge later. 

There could be so many inconclusive reasons for me being forgetful about my learned information: I am older (decay theory) or the information was never learned with the best attention. Nonetheless, to improve it, I am now trying two approaches: visualize concepts in a network graph and doing quizzes or questions frequently. 

The former seems doable, I can try coding it a bit if it is not too overkilled. I spent a few days during winter break reading about any Python libraries that help with interactive network features. While I believe there might be more efficient solutions, I experimented with Plotly's Dash, and it works adequately. I have myself a network of basic statistics concepts - here is a graph draft of several nodes of univariate distributions and others.

I appreciate any feedback or advice on the network graph! I am new to this kind of learning. An updated version in which I will add more data and nicer features is in a Render web service: [https://stats-review-network.onrender.com/](https://stats-review-network.onrender.com/). It runs on a free plan so the first loading might be slow.

The latter, learning by doing, is arguably more powerful. The homework and assignments from my courses are useful. However, I do not know about the other fellow students, but I feel rushed when doing homework and submitting it by deadlines. I usually take time to go over the questions and try thinking of the questions in a real-world context or simply looking for more exercises online. Still, the rush is probably necessary because we have to cover so much in a 9-week course. For this particular learning retention aspect, I am now spending the winter break on doing some practice exams online from some universities and thinking of ways to integrate Maximum Likelihood Estimation and some multivariate analysis techniques into a project idea. Every effort is for me to comfortably understand what to use in the future.
