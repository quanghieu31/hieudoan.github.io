Years ago, I planned to become an astronaut and play football on the moon. Time passed, plan changed. I am now working on data and policy with a dream of changing something for good.

I am a Master's student in [Computer Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago](https://capp.uchicago.edu/). Here, I am studying a mixture of statistics, math (linear algebra, discrete), algorithms, and economics. My academic niche is applied statistical learning, currently focusing on variable selection techniques, high-dimensional data processing, and causal inferences in health-related topics. My long-term goal is to leverage data science to drive rigorous evidence-based decisions that improve social and health outcomes. I am confident about Python, R, and SQL, although I still try to improve my Python programming and problem solving skills through [Advent-of-Code puzzles](https://github.com/quanghieu31/advent-of-code) and [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/hieunguyendq). Before graduate school, I used to work for an non-profit organization in Vietnam, in database engineering and program evaluation, where I learned a lot about civic technology. Other than academic and professional activities, I immerse myself in crime thrillers, ethical dilemmas, English football, and satirical shows.
