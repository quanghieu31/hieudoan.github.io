Very nice working on your first web! After many weekend hours, you did it. It was thrilling learning experience. I am proud of you, please don&amp;rsquo;t be skeptical of yourself, even though I bet that you are right now haha. Anyhow, if you feel so, remember that everything is going to be daijoubu.
Many thanks to my bro (Tran Viet Anh, https://cryptsu.github.io/) who has helped me so much during the design and development.</description></item></channel></rss>
